     <p>Camp Kesem is a free summer camp for kids whose parents are affected by cancer. It's a place for kids of all 
      ages to meet other kids like them, have fun, and have a safe place to express themselves. Kesem Tamu serves close 
      to 100 kids a year and is 5 days long over the summer. </p>
     <p>My men's organization, Century Men's Society, is the primary supporter of kesem. We raise money throughout the year for kesem.
      some of the ways we do this are through a personal fundrasing goal of $200, and Songfest, a dancing competition at A&M that awards the winners $20,000 to the winners
      charity of choice. We won last year! </p>
      <p> Our most important philantropy event is Watermelon Bash. Watermelon Bash is a watermelon smashing event hosted at A&M, that sells
     over 2,000 tickets and destroys several hundred pounds of watermelon with a variety of methods. Whether its a sledgehammer, a slingshot, or a baseball bat, we have it all.
      through this we raise over $70,000 a year for Camp Kesem. It's so much money that we are able to send money to other chapters, and recieve a hand written letter from kesem's national president every year.</p>
     <p>my personal contribution to kesem has been many service hours each semester, building a slingshot for watermelon bash, working a george straight concert in exchange for free catering watermelon bash, and most importantly being a
       counselor. Kesem has been the greatest experience I've had in college. Getting to be there to actually see the result of all of our hardwork throughout the school year is so rewarding.
      The kids are such a joy to be around, and its a great excuse to act like a big kid all over again. If you look below you can see me coated in shaving cream after my kids chose to sacrifice me to the messy olympics gods.</p>
      <p>I'm even more excited for this year, as I will be serving as an officer for Kesem. I will get to have the privilege to plan kesem this year and support even more kids through kesem.</p>
