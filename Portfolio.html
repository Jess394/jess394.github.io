      <h2>TRACKMANIA</h2>
      <p>This is currently a work in progress, but I am working on reverse engineering a reinforcement learning A.I. to help me learn machine learning. The A.I. is a incharge of racing a car around a set track, and slowly learns over successive generations of trial and error how to lap it correctly. below is the link to the git I'm following.</p>

    <h2>Image Scaler</h2>
    <p>I've created a fully fleshed out image scaler and sticher using Bi-linear interpolation. It was an exercise in applying math to a real world application using code. I really enjoyed it and it was fascinating how math could translate into images. I also wrote an entire error sweet to handle bad inputs such as negative numbers or numbers outside of the limits of the code. currently haven't uploaded it to GIT but when it is it will be attached to the link below.</p>
